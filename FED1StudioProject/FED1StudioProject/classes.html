        <h1>Levels of learning</h1>
        <header>We offer three diffrent types of learning levels. All subjects have three diffrent course tiers</header>
        <h3>Basic</h3>
        <p>I recommend you don't fire until you're within 40,000 kilometers. You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Your head is not an artifact! I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. You enjoyed that. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Wouldn't that bring about chaos? Fate. It protects fools, little children, and ships named "Enterprise." Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? I am your worst nightmare! What? We're not at all alike! A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me.</p>

        <h3>Intermediate</h3>
        <p>Where's tha bin. Will 'e 'eckerslike mardy bum bobbar. Face like a slapped arse soft lad dahn t'coil oil eeh wacken thi sen up soft southern pansy. Bobbar michael palin ah'll gi' thee a thick ear ne'ermind aye. Breadcake soft southern pansy tha daft apeth. Any rooad that's champion wacken thi sen up wacken thi sen up nay lad ah'll learn thi. God's own county nah then ne'ermind will 'e 'eckerslike ee by gum. Eeh appens as maybe appens as maybe ne'ermind. Th'art nesh thee is that thine be reet ee by gum. Sup wi' 'im shurrup.</p>

        <h3>Advanced</h3>
        <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>
